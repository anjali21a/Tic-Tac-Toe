# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is for one player to align three of their symbols (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. If all nine cells are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game results in a draw.
